//CURRENT STATE OF DEVELOPMENT

All basic features implemented, however, labeling only works on whole conversations for the moment.  Support for specific packets will be implemented by this weekend.
Also, formatting and labeling options will have options for reading in from a text file soon.

//ABOUT

tcp2d is a result of my wanting to produce pcap based data sets in Weka for testing machine learning algorithms.  The specific features I needed were the ability to 'mash' tcp streams by displaying the request and response packets side by side (for flow classification) and the ability to easily classify packets within a data set by label.

I found several projects which allowed for transferring pcap files to csv, however, they lacked the features I needed in order by build nice Weka data sets.  So, I started working on a (very simple and limited) tcp stream reassembler so that I could mash and classify packets and create the kinds of data sets I wanted to test.  It seems I wasn't alone in this either: https://list.scms.waikato.ac.nz/pipermail/wekalist/2010-August/049433.html

I've also added various filters for payload data and a formatting scheme that allows any field in the ip/tcp header to be displayed as a column of data, as well as the ability to dump binaries of reassembled payloads (see the '-B' option).  I'm also working on auto generating ARFF headers.  I feel like this project is just starting to get to a usable state, and I'll be building some training sets with it in the coming weeks/months that I'll share.  Hopefully some other people out there can find use in it as well.  

--M

//USAGE OPTIONS

Options with arguments:
-f --filename     	  (path to a packet capture file to be used)
-o --output 	 	  (name/path to an output file)
-d --delimitor	  	  (change the field delimitor, default is ',')
-c --classification-rules (allows classification of individual packets)
-m --format	  	  (change the fields displayed)

format example: -m 'srcip;dstip;tcpflags;ip_len;payload;'
will output the source ip, destination ip, tcp flags, ip length, and payload.
All data available in the header structs from netinet/ip.h and netinet/tcp.h isavailable and generally follows the naming convention of the struct variable name(i.e. ip_len) and must be followed by a semicolon.

Flags:
-L --list-conversations (shows all tcp conversations available in a data set)
-A --arff-header  /in development/(adds an arff header to the top of any output)
-H --no-header	  (disables column headings)
-T --text-payload (remove all non-printable values from payloads)
-X --hex-payload  (show all payloads as hex, most useful for document classification of payloads)
-S --split-output (split output streams into individual files)
-M --mash	  (print requests and responses on a single line)
-B --binary-dump  (dumps binary payloads from streams into indidual files for pcap mining)
-D --keep-duplicates (turns off dropping of duplicate packets)
-Q --quiet	  (disable stdout)
-N --no-wrap	  (print results as a single line)

//A FEW USAGE EXAMPLES

misc.)

Dumping binary files for each conversation recorded into current directory: ./tcp2d -f <pcap> -o <outfile> -B

Saving regular output to individual files: ./tcp2d -f <pcap> -o <outfile> -S 

1.) Mashed output of sequence number, ack number, and tcpflags.

./tcp2d -f samples/browsing_google_for_gnu.pcap -m "seq;ack;tcpflags;" -M

2.) The default display ("default;") which is also equivalent to the format options shown below:

./tcp2d -f samples/browsing_google_for_gnu.pcap -m "ts;seq;ack;srcip;srcport;dstip;dstport;"

3.) Showing the default display along with tcp flags, ip length, and a text only payload:

./tcp2d -f samples/browsing_google_for_gnu.pcap -m "default;tcpflags;ip_len;payload;" -T
