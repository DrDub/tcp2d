# By default a header is printed for each field.  To turn off headers use '-H'

# If you'd like to have a new header for each conversation (i.e. ip/port combo) use the '-S' option

# To 'mash' streams so that requests and responses appear on the same line use the '-M' option

# To change the delimitor from the default ',' to something else use the '-d <new_delimitor>' option

# To format the output, and access various fields in the packet data, you just need to use the '-m' options with any of the following text cues placed afterword.

# You can also save format settings to a file and load it with the '-h' option.  See format.ini as an example.

*note* Remember to end every field with a semi-colon ';'

Example: to output source ip, sequence number, ack flags, and hex payloads use this option.	` tcp2d -f <pcap> -m "srcip;seq;ackflag;payload;" -X`

default; -> timestamp, sequence number, acknowledgement number, src ip, src port, dst ip, dst port

tcpflags;-> All six tcp flags.	

payload; -> Payload (You can also filter this with the -T (text only) and -X (hex) options).

ts;	 -> Timestamp, sec and usec.

seq; 	 -> Sequence Number

ack;	 -> Acknowledgement Number

srcip;	 -> Source IP
	
dstip;	 -> Destination IP

srcport; -> Source Port

dstport; -> Destination Port

res1;	 -> Reserved bits in TCP Header
res2;

doff;	 -> Header Length (TCP Header)
