Individual packets can be labeled with classification rules using the '-c' option.

For efficiency, at this time, labeling a packet requires previous knowledge of its conversation number (as read by tcp2d) and the sequence number.

To get a list of conversations simply use the -L option ` tcp2d -f <pcap> -L `

Once you know the conversation number where your packet(s) will fall and their sequence number(s) simply input rules with the following format

*note* ending each rule with a semi-colon ';' is very important!

<conversation_number>:<sequence_number>,<sequence_number2>,...,<sequence_numberN>=<label_value>;

You can also define ranges with a dash like so: <conversation_number>:<sequence_number_low>-<sequence_number_high>=<label_value>;

If you would like to label an entire conversation at once simply use the sequence number 0.

Example 1:  Label the first and second conversation (every packet).
		`tcp2d -f <pcap> -c "1:0=fist_label;2:0=second_label;"`

	The results will appear as:
		...,label
		...,first_label
		...,first_label
		...,second_label
		...,second_label
		...,second_label
		...,-
		...,-
		and so on....

Example 2: Label packets from conversation 3 with sequence numbers 4,18, and 25-33
		`tcp2d -f <pcap> -c "3:4,18,25-33=a_more_specific_label"`

	The results will appear as
		..seq,label
		..1,-
		..3,-
	 	..4,a_more_specific_label
		..8,-
		..9,-
		..18,a_more_specific_label
	 	..21,-
		..25,a_more_specific_label
		..30,a_more_specific_label
		..31,a_more_specific_label
		..34,-
